    // color for brighter areas, and `toonColor2` is a red color for darker areas.
    // Use the light intensity to blend the two colors. Finally, to achieve the toon
    // silhouette outline, set a dark fragment color if the current fragment is located
    // near the edge of the 3D model. Use a reasonable value as the threshold for the
    // silhouette thickness (i.e. proximity to edge).
